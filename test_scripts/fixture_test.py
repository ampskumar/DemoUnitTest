'''
Hey Julia, a fixtureâ€™s scope defines how many times a fixture will be invoked and a Fixture can have 4 Scopes:

Module: If the Module scope is defined, the fixture will be created/invoked only once per module.

Class: With Class scope, one fixture will be created per class object.

Session: With the Session scope, the fixture will be created only once for entire test session.
 This is mainly used to manage Webdriver sessions.

Function: This is the default value for fixture scope and the fixture is executed/run once per test session.
